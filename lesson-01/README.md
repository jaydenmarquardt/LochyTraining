# Lesson 1: Basic HTML Structure

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basic structure of an HTML document
- Learn how to create headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Connect CSS and JavaScript files to HTML
- Create your first webpage

## What You'll Build

A simple personal webpage with:

- A main heading
- A paragraph about yourself
- A list of your hobbies

## Instructions

### Step 1: Open the Files

Open `index.html` in VS Code and in your browser to see the starting point.

### Step 2: Add Content

Look for the TODO comments in `index.html` and complete the following:

1. **Add a heading**: Replace the first TODO with an `<h1>` tag containing "Welcome to My First Webpage"

   ```html
   <h1>Welcome to My First Webpage</h1>
   ```

2. **Add a paragraph**: Replace the second TODO with a `<p>` tag describing yourself

   ```html
   <p>Write something about yourself here!</p>
   ```

3. **Add a list**: Replace the third TODO with an unordered list (`<ul>`) containing 3 hobbies
   ```html
   <ul>
     <li>Hobby 1</li>
     <li>Hobby 2</li>
     <li>Hobby 3</li>
   </ul>
   ```

### Step 3: Test Your Work

Save your file and refresh the browser to see your changes!

## Key HTML Tags Used

- `<h1>` - Main heading (also `<h2>`, `<h3>` for subheadings)
- `<p>` - Paragraph of text
- `<ul>` - Unordered (bulleted) list
- `<li>` - List item

## Tips

- HTML tags usually come in pairs: opening `<tag>` and closing `</tag>`
- Indentation makes your code easier to read
- Use meaningful content that represents you!

## Check Your Solution

When you're done, compare your work with the files in the `solution/` folder to see one possible implementation.
